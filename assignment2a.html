<h1>Assignment 2a Umar</h1>

<p>A topic I find interesting is <strong> kayaking.</strong>
There's sea kayaking and lake kayaking. 
<br>The most important thing to do when kayaking is to wear a life jacket.
<br>You also need to be a good swimmer just in case you flip.
<br>Kayaking in the sea is more difficult because of the stronger currents.
<br>A place thats nearby where you can rent kayaks is <a href="https://www.calkayak.com/"> click here</a><br>

          <br>  <p>Below is a picture of  a <strong>Kayak</strong>
